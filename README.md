# One Language, One Tool #

## Branching out and diversifying ##

This repository is holds the slides to a presentation given to the [UA Web Developer's Group](http://uaweb.arizona.edu/) on 2015-08-12.

The University of Arizona web development scene concentrates a lot on using Drupal and PHP to solve a lot of the web problems we have.
This isn't a bad thing, these solutions were chosen for a reason.
However, as we homogenize, we run the risk of making things harder for ourselves and losing out on progress made in the web development world outside of the university.
This presentation is to encourage people to explore these other solutions or more solutions on their own.

The slideshow was built using [Remark](http://remarkjs.com) and is available for viewing at http://awochna.github.io/one-language.
