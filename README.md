## Branching out and diversifying ##

This repository holds the slides to a presentation given to the [UA Web Developer's Group](http://uaweb.arizona.edu/) on 2015-08-12.

The University of Arizona web development scene concentrates a lot on using Drupal and PHP to solve a lot of the web problems we have.
This isn't a bad thing, these solutions were chosen for a reason.
However, as we homogenize, we run the risk of making some things harder for ourselves and losing out on progress made in the web development world outside of the university.
This presentation is to encourage people to explore these other solutions or more solutions on their own in the terms of edge cases that our current technology choices might be less than well-suited for.

This presentation will draw from my personal experience and show some tools and languages available for use to solve different problems.
As such, your experience will likely be different and the purpose isn't to say X is better than Y.
I'm not trying to start a flame war.
I just want to show you some cool things I found and maybe open your mind to finding alternative solutions.
The list won't be exhaustive by any means.

Given that it is an opinionated topic, discussion is encouraged and there will be some extra time at the end allotted for discussion.
There will be some technical topics discussed, but I'll try to cover a wide spectrum, so there'll be something for everyone.

The slideshow was built using [Remark](http://remarkjs.com) and is available for viewing at http://awochna.github.io/polyglot-developer.
