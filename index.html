      * Web Designer/Developer for Mel &amp; Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health

      ???

      * We mostly build grant, project, and center sites in Drupal for the people that need them.
      
      --

      * Favorite Programming Language: Ruby

      ???

      * It's beauty lies in it's syntax, it's object-oriented design, it's conventions, it's community, and that I feel like it really has been optimized for developer happiness.
